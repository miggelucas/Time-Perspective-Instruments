# Time-Perspective-Instruments

Evaluation of psychometric properties for a time perspective instrument for adolescents, investigating relationships with other psychological variables.

## Motivation

I'm a very curious person about how you can understand people's subjective traits. How can I know what intelligences are? Or maybe what is the difference between a shy person and an introvert? I learned that a good way to start is to try to measure these constructs. So, naturally, I started studying psychometrics. Part of that journey means getting better and better at making sense analysis so that I can explain why people might do or feel what they do. Fortunately, I had access to a great database to use as a playground to develop my R coding skill and improve my critical thinking.
