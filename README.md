# Time Perspective Instruments

Evaluation of psychometric properties for a time perspective instrument for adolescents, investigating relationships with other psychological variables.

## Motivation

I'm a very curious person about how you can understand people's subjective traits. How can I know what intelligences are? Or maybe what is the difference between a shy person and an introvert? I learned that a good way to start is to try to measure these constructs. So, naturally, I started studying psychometrics. Part of that journey means getting better and better at making sense analysis so that I can explain why people might do or feel what they do. Fortunately, I had access to a great database to use as a playground to develop my R coding skill and improve my critical thinking.


## Instruments

The database is composed of 7 different instruments

* Trust in a better future, Molinari, et al. 2016
* Adolescent Time Inventory - ATI, MELLO; WORRELL, 2016
* Student Life Satisfaction  (Dew and Huebner 1994)
* PURE PROCASTIATION SCALE (PPS)
* General Decision-Making Style Inventory (GDMS) (SCOTT; BRUCE, 1995)
* Perceived Stress Scale - PSS) (COHEN, KAMARCK, MERMELSTEIN, 1983 apud FARO, 2015
* Youth Social  Responsability Scale, PANCER et al., 2007

## Goal

1. Validate psychometrics properties of each instrument

2. Instrument scores of each individual

3. Correlation, cluster and regression exploratory analisys
